# Preface {-}

This notebook is simply a summary of the work I have done as a summer intern under Jonathan Godfrey at Massey University in 2022/23.

When I came back at the start of 2023 after summer break I decided to move over to bookdown rantehr than just one long rmd file.
I did this for 2 reasons
1. It is another learning experience
2. To give my nots more organisation and stop by really long rmd file from getting out of hand (already over 2000 lines)

This process was relatively simple just had to do some correction to my code so that the rmd would actually render properly. From there I started to do some basic splitting of the sections then got back to work.
